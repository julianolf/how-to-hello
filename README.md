# How-to 'Hello'

> Computer: the digital frontier. These are the voyages of a computer programmer. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new languages. To seek out new... whatever. To boldly code how no one has done before!

Don't take life so serious, and don't give this projeto too much attention.

## About

The most common introductory example for programming languages is a simple program that prints a "Hello, world" message. This project holds the implementation of the "Hello, world" program written in different programming languages.

## Why?

The main motivation, mostly driven by curiosity, is to learn at least a bit of different programming languages. But it's helpful to know that there might be a programming language out there that fits better for a specific purpose, maybe because it was designed to solve a problem, runs better in a platform, it's more efficient or productive.

## Goals

 1. Know the existence of different programming languages.
 2. Understand how they works and which problems they aim to solve.
 3. A brief introduction to their syntax and tools by implementing an example.

Let's say hello!
