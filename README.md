# How-to 'Hello'

![Test](https://github.com/julianolf/how-to-hello/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

The most common introductory example for programming languages is a simple program that prints a "hello world" message. This project holds the implementation of the "hello world" program written in different programming languages.

## Why?

Mostly driven by curiosity. But learn at least a bit of different programming languages might be helpful, specially know that there might be a programming language that fits better for a specific purpose, maybe because it was designed to solve a problem, runs better in a platform, is more efficient or productive.

## Goals

 1. Know about the existence of different programming languages.
 2. Understand how they work and which problems they aim to solve.
 3. A brief introduction to their syntax and tools by implementing an example.

Let's say hello!
