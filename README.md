# How-to 'Hello'

The most common introductory example for programming languages is a simple program that prints a "hello world" message. This project holds the implementation of the "hello world" program written in different programming languages.

## Why?

The main motivation, mostly driven by curiosity, is to learn at least a bit of different programming languages. But it's helpful to know that there might be a programming language out there that fits better for a specific purpose, maybe because it was designed to solve a problem, runs better in a platform, it's more efficient or productive.

## Goals

 1. Know the existence of different programming languages.
 2. Understand how they works and which problems they aim to solve.
 3. A brief introduction to their syntax and tools by implementing an example.

Let's say hello!
